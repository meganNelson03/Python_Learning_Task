=========================

Notes:
1) Part 1 of the project is in the PyTorchTutorial folder (examples with the CIFAR data set from the online tutorials provided)

2) Part 2 of the project is in the Final-TransferLearning folder (ants/bees classification assignment). Descriptions of the hyperparameters changed are in the TransferLearning.ipynb document.

3) Part 3 (extra credit) is in the ExtraCredit-CIFAR10 folder. 

The requirements.txt file has all the local dependencies required to run the .ipynb files.
The data files within the folders without anything in them will gather the required online datasets (CIFAR10) once the program is run.
